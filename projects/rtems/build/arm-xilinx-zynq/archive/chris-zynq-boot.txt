I am testing and developing RTEMS on a MicroZed board so I hope I can help.

A full build of all parts from source requires a few parts to come 
together. I use a FreeBSD package for the compiler to build u-boot. 
Everything else is from source.

I am using a 3rd option, u-boot on an SD card and booting over the 
network to download RTEMS to run.

1. Host machine is FreeBSD 10.3-RELEASE-p3.
  1.1 U-Boot needs an ARM compiler, using packages:
    arm-none-eabi-binutils-2.25.1_1
    arm-none-eabi-gcc-5.3.0

2. U-Boot
  2.1 From git:
     $ git clone git://git.denx.de/u-boot.git
  2.2 Local patch (attached).
  2.3 Build with:
     $ gmake CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi- CONFIG_API=y
  2.4 Copy spl/boot.bin to the SD card.
  2.5 Copy u-boot.img to the SD card.
  2.6 Create a suitable uEnv.txt to boot u-boot for your system.
       (My SD crad reader is at home at the moment)

3. RTEMS
  2.1 Build tools using the RSB for 4.12/rtems-arm.
  2.2 Get RTEMS from git:
     $ git clone git://git.rtems.org/rtems.git
    Note: this patch is need:
     https://lists.rtems.org/pipermail/devel/2016-August/015982.html
  2.3 Bootstrap
  2.4 Configure:
     $ ../rtems/configure --target=arm-rtems4.12 \
         --prefix=/opt/work/chris/rtems/kernel/4.12 \
         --disable-networking \
         --enable-rtemsbsp=xilinx_zynq_zedboard \
         --enable-smp \
         --enable-test
  2.5 Build:
     $ make -j 8
  2.6 Convert the RTEMS executable so u-boot can load it. I attach a
      script based on Pavel's posts. Please edit to your tools path:
     $ rtems-zynq-mkimg \
 
./arm-rtems4.12/c/xilinx_zynq_zedboard/testsuites/samples/ticker/ticker.exe
  2.7 Copy ticker.exe.img to the SD card or network download location.
